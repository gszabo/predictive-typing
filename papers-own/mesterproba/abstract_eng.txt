In this paper we summarize the research in the field of giving predictive translation typing capabilities to computer-assisted translation tools, including the TransType project. Then we present our dictionary based method, that uses simpler statistical techniques to extract possible text unit translations of a large, segmented, bilingual corpus. We investigated how using different types of text units (only words, bigrams or trigrams) affects the size and the goodness of the resulting dictionary. For measuring size of the dictionary both entry number and physical size are considered, and for measuring goodness we chose the ratio of number of keystrokes saved by translators to the length of the translation. Measurements were carried out for the English-German language pair.
